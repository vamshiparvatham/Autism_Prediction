## Overview

Early detection of **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)** can significantly improve outcomes by providing early interventions and tailored resources for children. This app utilizes a **Naive Bayes classifier** to predict the likelihood of autism in toddlers based on behavioral and developmental data. The model is designed to be **interpretable** and **accurate**, offering caregivers insights into their childâ€™s developmental health.

We began this project by exploring several key research papers related to **Graphical Models for Health Diagnosis**, including:

- [Detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder in Children Using Machine Learning Techniques](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42979-021-00776-5)
- [An accessible and efficient autism screening method for behavioural data and predictive analyses](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1460458218796636)
- [Employing Bayesian Networks for the Diagnosis and Prognosis of Diseases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06400)
- [Bayesian Networks for the Diagnosis and Prognosis of Diseases: A Scoping Review](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-4990/6/2/58)
- [An Intelligent Bayesian Hybrid Approach to Help Autism Diagnosis* by Paulo Vitor de Campos Souza et al](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00500-021-05877-0)
- [Impact of Bayesian Network Model Structure on the Accuracy of Medical Diagnostic Systems](https://ali-fahmi.github.io/files/papers/paper5.pdf)

Through this research, we gained foundational insights into Bayesian Networks, understanding their mathematical underpinnings, advantages, challenges, and applications in healthcare.One of the pivotal study, *[Detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder in Children Using Machine Learning Techniques](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42979-021-00776-5)*.

    ```
  

  ## Methodology

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**:
    - We used an autism screening dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fabdelja/autism-screening-for-toddlers). We cleaned and     preprocessed the data, addressing missing values and normalizing attributes.
3. **Modeling with Naive Bayes**:
    - Our initial classifier was Naive Bayes, chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in handling probabilistic predictions. We also experimented     with **Random Forest** and **Ensemble Models** for comparison.
4. **Frontend Implementation**:
    - To showcase the Naive Bayes classifier, we built a basic frontend using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS**.
5. **Testing and Evaluation**:
    - We compared model accuracy across Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Ensemble Models to determine the most reliable predictor. 
6. The whole project can be viewed on this repository.

## Results

The app provides **probabilistic predictions** with an emphasis on **interpretability**, helping caregivers understand which factors significantly influence autism likelihood.
